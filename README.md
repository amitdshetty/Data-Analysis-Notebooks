# Data-Analysis-Notebooks
All notebooks used in Data Analysis and Prediction Making

The notebooks were created  as part of my Machine Learning Course in University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

Each of these notebooks were created to analyze and predict outcomes for different types of datasets. The difference between each notebook is the technique used and the purpose of the analysis i.e. looking at the problem as a classification or as a regression problem.

Complex neural network model have also been explored alongside CPU and GPU tested models. The GPU models have been tested on my NVidia RTX 2060 machine.

To make it easy for anyone to read and understand the notebooks for anyone without having to go through a complicated setup process, I have exported my notebooks in a single file HTML file which can be opened in any modern web browser for users to study.
